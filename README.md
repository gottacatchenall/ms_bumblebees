## Abstract

Using a data set of [DESCRIBE EACH DATASET IN A NICE WAY], we predict
a spatiotemporally explicit metaweb of interactions between bumblebees
(_Bombus_) and wildflowers (within _find clade_). We integrate this
data with crowdsourced occurrence data and climate data to [best paint
the picture of the Colorado bumblebee-plant metaweb]. Using temporal
climate data, we forecast how the spatiotemporal overlap of
interacting species will change under proposed climate scenarios. We
use this to estimate what interactions between bees and plants need
the most attention to prevent the spatiotemporal decoupling of an
interactions from threatening ecosystem functioning or the persistence
of a species.

# Introduction

- We estimate the Colorado bumblebee/wild-flower pollination metaweb
using network embedding.
- Then decompose into spatial and temporally explicit network predictions
- Finally suggest a priority of sampling to improve our understanding of this system.
